# ðŸ”¥ Dev/Burn Pool

At various stages througout this document we refer to rewards and pools such as dev/burn pool.

The idea of our dev/burn pool is that at some point we will reach a state where there is no longer a huge requirement for the entire fund to be present.  The intention at these stages is to burn ERC20 Tokens from the dev/burn pool.  This is the same pool that receives a small % across the whole platform from various contracts and so we cannot fully predict how much funding will go there in total or how much value we can add to the token by burning this wen the time comes.\
\
All we can say for sure is that we have the potential along with our community to make this a great project with some real winners not only in prizes and other rewards but in the fantastic sci-fi art and story that we bring to you.\

Secure a partnership with Wenmint launchpad.&#x20;

M4s partnership with Wenmint will give our community confidence that not only are we doing everything possible to execute a smooth launch but give a piece of mind that we are launching through a Partner that has launched many successful projects in the past.

M4Mutantz NFT

Q1-2 2024

what will a genesis M4Rabbit, an M4Lab and the Ishii collection M4Doe create&#x20;

when their DNA is spliced and mutated? \


The Third collection from our partners at NVC Media Inc. &#x20;

The M4Mutantz: Art that is simply and literally Out Of This World! &#x20;

We can almost guarantee these mutated, mystery M4s will boost the value of your overall collection in the secondary markets, that is of course if anybody ever even sells them! &#x20;

Custom mutations will come from those who have collected certain artefacts (TBD) along the way and have them available in their M4Lab at that time. &#x20;

The M4Mutantz will be limited to 5000 total supply and upon closing the sale of the last NFT we will release over $1,000,000 Million dollars worth of incentives for the new mutant holders to win in games and giveaway competitions.

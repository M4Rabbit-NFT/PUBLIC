# ❄ Avalanche Utility Pass

The Millionaire Rabbit on AVAX in partnership with X. A 2D Utility Pass&#x20;

What Utility comes with a Millionaire Rabbit NFT?&#x20;

We intend to launch a 2D generative art collection as part of marketing strategy within the M4Rabbit project with the idea of primarily generating some cross platform interest in our Ethereum project, second to use the 2D NFT as a basic interest drawing token and "Utility Pass" which on proof of ownership will offer discounts across the whole of the M4Rabbit project through to 2024.



Professional 2D artwork that was commissioned as part of our journey before we turned to the 3D world will be offered at a base price of 0.5 AVAX to those on the AVALANCH Network who are interested in the project. ​ ​&#x20;



The 2D rabbit is called “Millionaire Rabbit – A Sophisticated and wealthy little bunny” NFT Features a Simple contract with everything as standard. Metadata URL will remain hidden until M4Rabbit WHITELIST opens. ​&#x20;



In the generative set there will be the following:&#x20;

100 WHITELIST spots will be won by way of a special symbol on their NFT&#x20;

10 M4Rabbit NFTs will be AWARDED by way of a special symbol on their NFT&#x20;

10 Mint Passes for 5,000 $M4Spore ERC20 token by way of a special symbol on their NFT ​&#x20;

A large percentage of our ERC20 Token allocation on the Ethereum network is to rewards and we have agreed that at the 500 mint point of M4Rabbit, we will buy back all of the 2D AVAX Collection for ERC20 $M4Spore Token which the team will fund, almost guaranteeing buyers on AVALANCH will at the minimum receive the cost they paid for their AVAX Millionaire Rabbit NFT by way of an Ethereum ERC20 Payment in M4Spore.&#x20;

We would like to offer and develop the ability for our NFT HODLERS to stake their M4 NFTs on Ethereum and choose to earn token rewards on a selection of networks such as solana and avalanche in the future. ​

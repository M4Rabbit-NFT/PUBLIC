# ðŸŽŸ Interplanetary Lottery

What is an interplanetary Lottery?

\


Our interplanetary Lottery is a traditional number match lottery. The goal is to match consecutive numbers. The interplanetary lottery allows every user who bought at least one lottery ticket to be awarded with prizes. All prizes and bets are in our ERC20 UTILITY TOKEN which can be exchanged in the exchange for cash or used to buy items in game and in the markets including online and IRL merchandise that can be delivered right to your door!

\


How do I enter, and how do I win?

\


You will have the chance to pick a series of random numbers for each ticket, or the option to choose your numbers manually according to your preference.&#x20;

The winning numbers will be generated at a predetermined time automatically by our vrf random number generation system to guarantee fairness and security of the lottery.

\


&#x20;   â€¢ Valid lottery token: buy with $ERC20 (or BNB/USDT via instant exchange)

&#x20;   â€¢ Max tickets at a time: A maximum of 10 tickets can be bought in one transaction.

&#x20;   â€¢ User entry limit: A maximum of 100 tickets per address.

&#x20;   â€¢ Duration: Lottery rounds reset at predetermined intervals TBD.&#x20;

&#x20;   â€¢ Each ticket has a 6-digit numerical string with each digit being between 0-9.

How do I win?

\


Numbers counted against the draw as follows from left to right:

Ticket x: 1 2 6 8 7 9&#x20;

Ticket y: 1 4 3 8 7 9&#x20;

Winning Number: 1 4 3 4 7 9&#x20;

\


For this example the result would be:

Ticket x: The first digit matches and the second doesnâ€™t so there is no more sequence and so  this ticket wins a "Match first number" prize.

Ticket y: The first 3 digits match and the 4th doesnâ€™t so the sequence ends meaning that this ticket wins a "Match first three numbers" prize.

Prize Funds

\


The prizes for each lottery round come from two sources:

â€¢ Lottery Ticket Sales:

\


75% of the ticket sale amount is allocated to the game's prize pool and is distributed to players with the rest being allocated to M4 NFT rewards (18%), platform development and maintenance and other ad-hoc prizes (7%).

\


â€¢ Accumulated prizes (rollover):

\


If there is no winner in a specific lottery prize bracket then 50% of the unclaimed rewards for that bracket will accumulate into the next round and will be distributed among all the prize pools in the proceeding lottery. The remaining 50% is destined to be split between:&#x20;

\


(NFT rewards 35%)&#x20;

(Other prizes 15%)&#x20;

(Platform dev and maintenance 15%)&#x20;

(Burn 35%) Which will have the effect of deflating the token by a small amount each time there is a rollover.

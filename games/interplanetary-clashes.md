# üè¥‚ò† OCCUPY VALLARA

OCCUPY VALLARA IS A BATTLE SHIPS TYPE MECHANIC COVERING THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF VALLARA



How do I play, how do I win?

To play you will need to fit one of the following profiles

1\. Hold minimum 500 M4Spore 5 x M4 and 20 x Corresponding LAND NFTs

2\. Form a GUILD with others of your FACTION to fit profile 1 above

3\. HOLD a Sacred Site NFT and sufficient M4Spore to populate your site.  You will need at least 1 x M4 NFT and 4 x LAND NFTs of the same faction and you can replace the remaining 20 blocks with an M4Spore stake in order to play equal to 100 M4Spore for every block you cant populate + 7%.

A new Sacred Sites NFT can be claimed by any one person or group/GUILD holding 5 x M4 NFTs and 20 x LAND NFTs of the same FACTION\


When you play you will select grid coordinates to attack.

A hit in the outer square will take a % of that sites staked M4Spore and award it to the attacking GUILD.\
\
The % for the inner square and then the single inner block are higher respectively.  \
\
Hitting the inner block on the first try releases 1/3 of that sites staked M4Spore -  a block may have shielding and more than one hit required\
\
HOLDING MILRABS and ETHRABS = SHIELDS

Shields can be applied by staking these NFTs in a similar way\
so to protect block 15 for example so that it required 4 x hits to damage would require a stake of 3 x milrabs or ethrabs allocated to block 15.\
\
maximum shielding is 3 per square meaning you can protect a square from attack 3 times and the fourth hit will cause damage.\
\
repair and maintenance will be deactivated in the begining and after stability is reached players will be able to repair their damaged sites daily.\
\
in the begining phase the game will work like a three hit win with different % paid out for hitting different parts of the other sites and a player or guild can move their site to a random location by forfeit of their turn.

turns will be 1 x daily with a maximum of three shots fired on to the map.&#x20;

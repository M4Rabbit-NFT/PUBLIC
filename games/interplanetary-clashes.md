# üè¥‚ò† Interplanetary Clashes

Interplanetary Clash is a fight betting system where you will choose a planet to win in a clash, these selected planets will enter a 1 v 1 battle in which only one planet will remain habitable. Be cautious! It is not always that the strongest or smartest planet will emerge as the victor of the Interplanetary Clash, The Spore can be cunning.



How do I play, how do I win?



The game functions on a betting system where you buy tickets to support a  bet on the planet of your choice. If your planet is the winner the opponent's bets will be shared among you and the other  winners who bet on that planet. Your reward will be proportionally equal to the number of winning tickets you have purchased vs the other winners in the pool.\


Interplanetary Clashes may take place as frequently as every 3 to 5 days.



7% of the total collected amount goes back to the project dev/burn pool whilst 25% goes to M4 Rabbit NFT holder REWARDS and the remaining 68%  is allocated as the prizes explained above.

The two planets from each Interplanetary Clash will be placed on 7 day auction starting at GAS PRICE + $1 and their NFTs can be purchased and held as novelty or until such time as we introduce them into a future part of the gaming experience as M4 Federation Lands.

50% of the auction price of the Clashed Planets that are sold after Interplanetary Clashes will be destined for the M4Rabbit NFT rewards pool. &#x20;

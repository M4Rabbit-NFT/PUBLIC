Why Will Crypto Investors Want to Fill their Bags with $M4Spore Tokens?



The $M4Spore ERC20 token will be integrated within the platform in various ways and in each of these ways in order to function there will be a fees system.  This fees system is linked directly to extra incentives and gifts available via games with rewards up to $2000.00 in value that are free to enter and win for NFT holders and early token adopters.



* Scenario 1: The $M4Spore Token itself will be used as internal currency for the platform to buy and sell NFTâ€™s in the marketplace after initial sales.&#x20;
* Scenario 2: Users can win $M4Spore ERC20 tokens in their wallet and exchange them for other crypto as well as use them in the M4 Metaverse.
* Scenario 3: $M4Spore Token can be bought publicly to PLAY and WIN in online games and competitions.&#x20;
* Scenario 4: Token can be used to purchase merchandise at a discount â€“ community decision by holder majority vote.  Clothing, posters, prints,3d prints, ceramics etc.
* Scenario 5: $M4Spore Token can be staked to earn a % over locked periods and the token will be used as the payout Currency for staked NFTs.



Our team will decide when and how the various scenarios will be implemented.  And deal with verifiably taking votes from the HOLDERS. Launch dates will be advised well in advance and early subscribers will benefit from discounts.



We Hope crypto investors will see the use case of the token and the 100x potential and also invest and hold both M4 Rabbit NFT and $M4Spore ERC20 tokens and/or trade/stake them.  &#x20;

## Games

Interplanetary Lottery

What is an interplanetary Lottery?



Our interplanetary Lottery is a traditional number match lottery. The goal is to match consecutive numbers. The interplanetary lottery allows every user who bought at least one lottery ticket to be awarded with prizes. All prizes and bets are in our ERC20 UTILITY TOKEN which can be exchanged in the exchange for cash or used to buy items in game and in the markets including online and IRL merchandise that can be delivered right to your door!



How do I enter, and how do I win?



You will have the chance to pick a series of random numbers for each ticket, or the option to choose your numbers manually according to your preference.&#x20;

The winning numbers will be generated at a predetermined time automatically by our vrf random number generation system to guarantee fairness and security of the lottery.



&#x20;   â€¢ Valid lottery token: buy with $ERC20 (or BNB/USDT via instant exchange)

&#x20;   â€¢ Max tickets at a time: A maximum of 10 tickets can be bought in one transaction.

&#x20;   â€¢ User entry limit: A maximum of 100 tickets per address.

&#x20;   â€¢ Duration: Lottery rounds reset at predetermined intervals TBD.&#x20;

&#x20;   â€¢ Each ticket has a 6-digit numerical string with each digit being between 0-9.

\
How do I win?



Numbers counted against the draw as follows from left to right:

Ticket x: 1 2 6 8 7 9&#x20;

Ticket y: 1 4 3 8 7 9&#x20;

Winning Number: 1 4 3 4 7 9&#x20;



For this example the result would be:

Ticket x: The first digit matches and the second doesnâ€™t so there is no more sequence and so  this ticket wins a "Match first number" prize.

Ticket y: The first 3 digits match and the 4th doesnâ€™t so the sequence ends meaning that this ticket wins a "Match first three numbers" prize.



Prize Funds

\
The prizes for each lottery round come from two sources:

â€¢ Lottery Ticket Sales:

\
75% of the ticket sale amount is allocated to the game's prize pool and is distributed to players with the rest being allocated to M4 NFT rewards (18%), platform development and maintenance and other ad-hoc prizes (7%).



â€¢ Accumulated prizes (rollover):

\
If there is no winner in a specific lottery prize bracket then 50% of the unclaimed rewards for that bracket will accumulate into the next round and will be distributed among all the prize pools in the proceeding lottery. The remaining 50% is destined to be split between:&#x20;



(NFT rewards 35%)&#x20;

(Other prizes 15%)&#x20;

(Platform dev and maintenance 15%)&#x20;

(Burn 35%) Which will have the effect of deflating the token by a small amount each time there is a rollover.



Prize Awards

Tickets belonging to the Prize Pools described above are allocated as follows:

Prize Bracket Description / Percentage of Prize Pool:



Match First number                2%

Match First 2 numbers            3%

Match First 3 numbers            5%

Match First 4 numbers            15%

Match First 5 numbers            20%

Match First 6 numbers            30%

NFT reward pool                 18%

Dev / Maintenance / Burn            7%



Interplanetary Clashes

\
Interplanetary Clash is a fight betting system where you will choose a planet to win in a clash, these selected planets will enter a 1 v 1 battle in which only one planet will remain habitable. Be cautious! It is not always that the strongest or smartest planet will emerge as the victor of the Interplanetary Clash.



How do I play, how do I win?



The game functions on a betting system where you buy tickets to support a  bet on the planet of your choice. If your planet is the winner the opponent's bets will be shared among you and the other  winners who bet on that planet. Your reward will be proportionally equal to the number of winning tickets you have purchased vs the other winners in the pool.



Interplanetary Clashes may take place as frequently as every 24-72 hours.



7% of the total collected amount goes back to the project dev/burn pool whilst 25% goes to M4 Rabbit NFT holder REWARDS and the remaining 68%  is allocated as the prizes explained above.

The two planets from each Interplanetary Clash will be placed on 7 day auction starting at GAS PRICE + $1 and their NFTs can be purchased and held as novelty or until such time as we introduce them into a future part of the gaming experience.

50% of the auction price of the Clashed Planets that are sold after Interplanetary Clashes will be destined for the M4Rabbit NFT rewards pool. &#x20;



Benefits for M4Rabbit  NFT HOLDERS (investors):

\


From the outset of our launch there will be an initial 20% of each NFT sale injected into the rewards pool for NFTs. &#x20;

7% across the board from every transaction, PVP battle,  sale, transfer and conversion of ERC20 will be injected into the NFT reward pool.

50% of the auction price of the Clashed Planets that are sold after Interplanetary Clashes will be destined for the NFT reward pool. &#x20;

Any future action that generates an income or that will charge a fee across the platform of 7% minimum is allocated to M4Rabbit NFT Hodlers.

\
\


Random VRF and bot control

\


We have a custom random number generator with the help of Chainlink VRF  and we can consistently deliver trusted unpredictable random numbers.

This spans the whole of our Metaverse and therefore we can create mechanisms moving forwards that will allow players a fair environment for their games.

Verifiably Random!

\


All numbers used for Lottery, games and Battling are generated on the fly alongside various traits and properties of our NFT assets, using Chainlink VRF so there is no way for anyone to manipulate the process and as such we can GUARANTEE that the winners are always unique and fully RANDOM!
